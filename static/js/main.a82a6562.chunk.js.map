No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?\"\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          Section 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\", written by Cicero in 45 BC\n          \"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga.

Rackham\n          \"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.\" */}\n        </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      </>\n    );\n  }","import React, { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { Document, Page } from \"react-pdf\";\nimport \"bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\";\nimport \"../../index.css\";\nimport resumePDF from \"../../assets/MettlerResume2020_tech.pdf\";\n\nimport { Button, Nav } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\n\nexport default function Resume() {\n  const [numPages, setNumPages] = useState(null);\n  const [pageNumber, setPageNumber] = useState(1);\n \n  function onDocumentLoadSuccess({ numPages }) {\n    setNumPages(numPages);\n  }\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div id=\"bodydiv\">\n          <Document file={resumePDF} onLoadSuccess={onDocumentLoadSuccess}>\n            <Page pageNumber={pageNumber} />\n          </Document>\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\";\nimport \"../../index.css\";\n\nimport codeImage from \"../../assets/code.png\";\n\nimport { Button, Nav, Image } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\nexport default function About() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div id=\"bodydiv\">\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\";\nimport \"../../index.css\";\n\nimport { Button, Nav } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\nexport default function John() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div id='bodydiv'>\n        <p>\n          1:1: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the\n          Word was God.\n          <br />\n          1:2: The same was in the beginning with God.\n          <br />\n          1:3: All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing\n          made that was made.\n          <br />\n          1:4: In him was life; and the life was the light of men.\n          <br />\n          1:5: And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended\n          it not.\n          <br />\n          1:6: There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.\n          <br />\n          1:7: The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that\n          all men through him might believe.\n          <br />\n          1:8: He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that\n          Light.\n          <br />\n          1:9: That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh\n          into the world.\n          <br />\n          1:10: He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the\n          world knew him not.\n          <br />\n          1:11: He came unto his own, and his own received him not.\n          <br />\n          1:12: But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the\n          sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:\n          <br />\n          1:13: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor\n          of the will of man, but of God.\n          <br />\n          1:14: And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld\n          his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of\n          grace and truth.\n          <br />\n          1:15: John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom\n          I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was\n          before me.\n          <br />\n          1:16: And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.\n          <br />\n          1:17: For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by\n          Jesus Christ.\n          <br />\n          1:18: No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which\n          is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.\n          <br />\n          1:19: And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and\n          Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?\n          <br />\n          1:20: And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the\n          Christ.\n          <br />\n          1:21: And they asked him, What then?

Then said they to him, We be not\n          born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.\n          <br />\n          8:42: Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me:\n          for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but\n          he sent me.\n          <br />\n          8:43: Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear\n          my word.\n          <br />\n          8:44: Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye\n          will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the\n          truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he\n          speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.\n          <br />\n          8:45: And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.\n          <br />\n          8:46: Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why\n          do ye not believe me?\n          <br />\n          8:47: He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them\n          not, because ye are not of God.\n          <br />\n          8:48: Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that\n          thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?\n          <br />\n          8:49: Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and\n          ye do dishonour me.\n          <br />\n          8:50: And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and\n          judgeth.\n          <br />\n          8:51: Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he\n          shall never see death.\n          <br />\n          8:52: Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil.\n          Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my\n          saying, he shall never taste of death.\n          <br />\n          8:53: Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the\n          prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?\n          <br />\n          8:54: Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is\n          my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:\n          <br />\n          8:55: Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say,\n          I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and\n          keep his saying.\n          <br />\n          8:56: Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and\n          was glad.\n          <br />\n          8:57: Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old,\n          and hast thou seen Abraham?\n          <br />\n          8:58: Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before\n          Abraham was, I am.\n          <br />\n          8:59: Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself,\n          and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so\n          passed by.\n          <br />\n          9:1: And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his\n          birth.\n          <br />\n          9:2: And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this\n          man, or his parents, that he was born blind?\n          <br />\n          9:3: Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents:\n          but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.\n          <br />\n          9:4: I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the\n          night cometh, when no man can work.\n          <br />\n          9:5: As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\n          <br />\n          9:6: When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of\n          the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,\n          <br />\n          9:7: And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by\n          interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came\n          seeing.\n          <br />\n          9:8: The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that\n          he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?\n          <br />\n          9:9: Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said,\n          I am he.\n          <br />\n          9:10: Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?\n          <br />\n          9:11: He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and\n          anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and\n          wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.\n          <br />\n          9:12: Then said they unto him, Where is he?

He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed,\n          and do see.\n          <br />\n          9:16: Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God,\n          because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man\n          that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among\n          them.\n          <br />\n          9:17: They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that\n          he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.\n          <br />\n          9:18: But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been\n          blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him\n          that had received his sight.\n          <br />\n          9:19: And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was\n          born blind? how then doth he now see?\n          <br />\n          9:20: His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our\n          son, and that he was born blind:\n          <br />\n          9:21: But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened\n          his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for\n          himself.\n          <br />\n          9:22: These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for\n          the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was\n          Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.\n          <br />\n          9:23: Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.\n          <br />\n          9:24: Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto\n          him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.\n          <br />\n          9:25: He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not:\n          one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.\n          <br />\n          9:26: Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he\n          thine eyes?\n          <br />\n          9:27: He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear:\n          wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?\n          <br />\n          9:28: Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we\n          are Moses' disciples.\n          <br />\n          9:29: We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know\n          not from whence he is.\n          <br />\n          9:30: The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous\n          thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine\n          eyes.\n          <br />\n          9:31: Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a\n          worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.\n          <br />\n          9:32: Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the\n          eyes of one that was born blind.\n          <br />\n          9:33: If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.\n          <br />\n          9:34: They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in\n          sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.\n          <br />\n          9:35: Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found\n          him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?\n          <br />\n          9:36: He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on\n          him?\n          <br />\n          9:37: And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he\n          that talketh with thee.\n          <br />\n          9:38: And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.\n          <br />\n          9:39: And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that\n          they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made\n          blind.\n          <br />\n          9:40: And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words,\n          and said unto him, Are we blind also?\n          <br />\n          9:41: Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin:\n          but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.\n          <br />\n          10:1: Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door\n          into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a\n          thief and a robber.\n          <br />\n          10:2: But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the\n          sheep.\n          <br />\n          10:3: To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he\n          calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.\n          <br />\n          10:4: And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them,\n          and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.\n          <br />\n          10:5: And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for\n          they know not the voice of strangers.\n          <br />\n          10:6: This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what\n          things they were which he spake unto them.\n          <br />\n          10:7: Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you,\n          I am the door of the sheep.\n          <br />\n          10:8: All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the\n          sheep did not hear them.\n          <br />\n          10:9: I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and\n          shall go in and out, and find pasture.\n          <br />\n          10:10: The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to\n          destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have\n          it more abundantly.\n          <br />\n          10:11: I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for\n          the sheep.\n          <br />\n          10:12: But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the\n          sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and\n          fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.\n          <br />\n          10:13: The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not\n          for the sheep.\n          <br />\n          10:14: I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of\n          mine.\n          <br />\n          10:15: As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay\n          down my life for the sheep.\n          <br />\n          10:16: And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I\n          must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold,\n          and one shepherd.\n          <br />\n          10:17: Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life,\n          that I might take it again.\n          <br />\n          10:18: No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.

This\n          commandment have I received of my Father.\n          <br />\n          10:19: There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these\n          sayings.\n          <br />\n          10:20: And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye\n          him?\n          <br />\n          10:21: Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil.\n          Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?\n          <br />\n          10:22: And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was\n          winter.\n          <br />\n          10:23: And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.\n          <br />\n          10:24: Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long\n          dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.\n          <br />\n          10:25: Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works\n          that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.\n          <br />\n          10:26: But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said\n          unto you.\n          <br />\n          10:27: My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:\n          <br />\n          10:28: And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish,\n          neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.\n          <br />\n          10:29: My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man\n          is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.\n          <br />\n          10:30: I and my Father are one.\n          <br />\n          10:31: Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.\n          <br />\n          10:32: Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my\n          Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?\n          <br />\n          10:33: The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee\n          not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest\n          thyself God.\n          <br />\n          10:34: Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye\n          are gods?\n          <br />\n          10:35: If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the\n          scripture cannot be broken;\n          <br />\n          10:36: Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into\n          the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?\n          <br />\n          10:37: If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.\n          <br />\n          10:38: But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that\n          ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.\n          <br />\n          10:39: Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of\n          their hand,\n          <br />\n          10:40: And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at\n          first baptized; and there he abode.\n          <br />\n          10:41: And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but\n          all things that John spake of this man were true.\n          <br />\n          10:42: And many believed on him there.\n          <br />\n          11:1: Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town\n          of Mary and her sister Martha.\n          <br />\n          11:2: (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and\n          wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)\n          <br />\n          11:3: Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he\n          whom thou lovest is sick.\n          <br />\n          11:4: When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death,\n          but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified\n          thereby.\n          <br />\n          11:5: Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.\n          <br />\n          11:6: When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days\n          still in the same place where he was.\n          <br />\n          11:7: Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea\n          again.\n          <br />\n          11:8: His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to\n          stone thee; and goest thou thither again?\n          <br />\n          11:9: Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any\n          man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of\n          this world.\n          <br />\n          11:10: But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is\n          no light in him.\n          <br />\n          11:11: These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our\n          friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.\n          <br />\n          11:12: Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.\n          <br />\n          11:13: Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had\n          spoken of taking of rest in sleep.\n          <br />\n          11:14: Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.\n          <br />\n          11:15: And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the\n          intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.\n          <br />\n          11:16: Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his\n          fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.\n          <br />\n          11:17: Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave\n          four days already.\n          <br />\n          11:18: Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs\n          off:\n          <br />\n          11:19: And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them\n          concerning their brother.\n          <br />\n          11:20: Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went\n          and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.\n          <br />\n          11:21: Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my\n          brother had not died.\n          <br />\n          11:22: But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God\n          will give it thee.\n          <br />\n          11:23: Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.\n          <br />\n          11:24: Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the\n          resurrection at the last day.\n          <br />\n          11:25: Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he\n          that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:\n          <br />\n          11:26: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.\n          Believest thou this?\n          <br />\n          11:27: She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the\n          Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.\n          <br />\n          11:28: And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her\n          sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.\n          <br />\n          11:29: As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto\n          him.\n          <br />\n          11:30: Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place\n          where Martha met him.\n          <br />\n          11:31: The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted\n          her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out,\n          followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.\n          <br />\n          11:32: Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell\n          down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my\n          brother had not died.\n          <br />\n          11:33: When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping\n          which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,\n          <br />\n          11:34: And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord,\n          come and see.\n          <br />\n          11:35: Jesus wept.\n          <br />\n          11:36: Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!\n          <br />\n          11:37: And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the\n          eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have\n          died?\n          <br />\n          11:38: Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave.\n          It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.\n          <br />\n          11:39: Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him\n          that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he\n          hath been dead four days.\n          <br />\n          11:40: Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou\n          wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?\n          <br />\n          11:41: Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was\n          laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee\n          that thou hast heard me.\n          <br />\n          11:42: And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the\n          people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast\n          sent me.\n          <br />\n          11:43: And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice,\n          Lazarus, come forth.\n          <br />\n          11:44: And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with\n          graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith\n          unto them, Loose him, and let him go.\n          <br />\n          11:45: Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the\n          things which Jesus did, believed on him.\n          <br />\n          11:46: But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told\n          them what things Jesus had done.\n          <br />\n          11:47: Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council,\n          and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.\n          <br />\n          11:48: If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the\n          Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.\n          <br />\n          11:49: And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that\n          same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,\n          <br />\n          11:50: Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should\n          die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.\n          <br />\n          11:51: And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that\n          year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;\n          <br />\n          11:52: And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather\n          together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.\n          <br />\n          11:53: Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put\n          him to death.\n          <br />\n          11:54: Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went\n          thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called\n          Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.\n          <br />\n          11:55: And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of\n          the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.\n          <br />\n          11:56: Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they\n          stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the\n          feast?\n          <br />\n          11:57: Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a\n          commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it,\n          that they might take him.\n          <br />\n          12:1: Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where\n          Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.\n          <br />\n          12:2: There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was\n          one of them that sat at the table with him.\n          <br />\n          12:3: Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly,\n          and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and\n          the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.\n          <br />\n          12:4: Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son,\n          which should betray him,\n          <br />\n          12:5: Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and\n          given to the poor?\n          <br />\n          12:6: This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was\n          a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.\n          <br />\n          12:7: Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying\n          hath she kept this.\n          <br />\n          12:8: For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.\n          <br />\n          12:9: Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and\n          they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus\n          also, whom he had raised from the dead.\n          <br />\n          12:10: But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus\n          also to death;\n          <br />\n          12:11: Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and\n          believed on Jesus.\n          <br />\n          12:12: On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when\n          they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,\n          <br />\n          12:13: Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and\n          cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name\n          of the Lord.\n          <br />\n          12:14: And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is\n          written,\n          <br />\n          12:15: Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on\n          an ass's colt.\n          <br />\n          12:16: These things understood not his disciples at the first: but\n          when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were\n          written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.\n          <br />\n          12:17: The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus\n          out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.\n          <br />\n          12:18: For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard\n          that he had done this miracle.\n          <br />\n          12:19: The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how\n          ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.\n          <br />\n          12:20: And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to\n          worship at the feast:\n          <br />\n          12:21: The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of\n          Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.\n          <br />\n          12:22: Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip\n          tell Jesus.\n          <br />\n          12:23: And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son\n          of man should be glorified.\n          <br />\n          12:24: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall\n          into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth\n          forth much fruit.\n          <br />\n          12:25: He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his\n          life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.\n          <br />\n          12:26: If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there\n          shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father\n          honour.\n          <br />\n          12:27: Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me\n          from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.\n          <br />\n          12:28: Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven,\n          saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.\n          <br />\n          12:29: The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it\n          thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.\n          <br />\n          12:30: Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but\n          for your sakes.\n          <br />\n          12:31: Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this\n          world be cast out.\n          <br />\n          12:32: And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto\n          me.\n          <br />\n          12:33: This he said, signifying what death he should die.\n          <br />\n          12:34: The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that\n          Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be\n          lifted up? who is this Son of man?\n          <br />\n          12:35: Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with\n          you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he\n          that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.\n          <br />\n          12:36: While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the\n          children of light.

They said therefore\n          unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and\n          said, I am not.\n          <br />\n          18:26: One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose\n          ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?\n          <br />\n          18:27: Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.\n          <br />\n          18:28: Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment:\n          and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall,\n          lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.\n          <br />\n          18:29: Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring\n          ye against this man?\n          <br />\n          18:30: They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor,\n          we would not have delivered him up unto thee.\n          <br />\n          18:31: Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him\n          according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not\n          lawful for us to put any man to death:\n          <br />\n          18:32: That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake,\n          signifying what death he should die.\n          <br />\n          18:33: Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called\n          Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?\n          <br />\n          18:34: Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did\n          others tell it thee of me?\n          <br />\n          18:35: Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief\n          priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?\n          <br />\n          18:36: Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom\n          were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be\n          delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.\n          <br />\n          18:37: Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus\n          answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and\n          for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto\n          the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.\n          <br />\n          18:38: Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said\n          this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in\n          him no fault at all.\n          <br />\n          18:39: But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the\n          passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the\n          Jews?\n          <br />\n          18:40: Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas.\n          Now Barabbas was a robber.\n          <br />\n          19:1: Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.\n          <br />\n          19:2: And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his\n          head, and they put on him a purple robe,\n          <br />\n          19:3: And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their\n          hands.\n          <br />\n          19:4: Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold,\n          I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in\n          him.\n          <br />\n          19:5: Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the\n          purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!\n          <br />\n          19:6: When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they\n          cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them,\n          Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.\n          <br />\n          19:7: The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to\n          die, because he made himself the Son of God.\n          <br />\n          19:8: When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;\n          <br />\n          19:9: And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus,\n          Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.\n          <br />\n          19:10: Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest\n          thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release\n          thee?\n          <br />\n          19:11: Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me,\n          except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me\n          unto thee hath the greater sin.\n          <br />\n          19:12: And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews\n          cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's\n          friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.\n          <br />\n          19:13: When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus\n          forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the\n          Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.\n          <br />\n          19:14: And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth\n          hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!\n          <br />\n          19:15: But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him.\n          Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests\n          answered, We have no king but Caesar.\n          <br />\n          19:16: Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And\n          they took Jesus, and led him away.\n          <br />\n          19:17: And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the\n          place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:\n          <br />\n          19:18: Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either\n          side one, and Jesus in the midst.\n          <br />\n          19:19: And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the\n          writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.\n          <br />\n          19:20: This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where\n          Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in\n          Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.\n          <br />\n          19:21: Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not,\n          The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.\n          <br />\n          19:22: Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.\n          <br />\n          19:23: Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his\n          garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his\n          coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.\n          <br />\n          19:24: They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but\n          cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be\n          fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my\n          vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.\n          <br />\n          19:25: Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his\n          mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.\n          <br />\n          19:26: When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing\n          by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!\n          <br />\n          19:27: Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that\n          hour that disciple took her unto his own home.\n          <br />\n          19:28: After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now\n          accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.\n          <br />\n          19:29: Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a\n          spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.\n          <br />\n          19:30: When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is\n          finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.\n          <br />\n          19:31: The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the\n          bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that\n          sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be\n          broken, and that they might be taken away.\n          <br />\n          19:32: Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of\n          the other which was crucified with him.\n          <br />\n          19:33: But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already,\n          they brake not his legs:\n          <br />\n          19:34: But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and\n          forthwith came there out blood and water.\n          <br />\n          19:35: And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he\n          knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.\n          <br />\n          19:36: For these things were done, that the scripture should be\n          fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.\n          <br />\n          19:37: And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom\n          they pierced.\n          <br />\n          19:38: And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus,\n          but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take\n          away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore,\n          and took the body of Jesus.\n          <br />\n          19:39: And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus\n          by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred\n          pound weight.\n          <br />\n          19:40: Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes\n          with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.\n          <br />\n          19:41: Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and\n          in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.\n          <br />\n          19:42: There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews'\n          preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.\n          <br />\n          20:1: The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it\n          was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from\n          the sepulchre.\n          <br />\n          20:2: Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other\n          disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away\n          the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid\n          him.\n          <br />\n          20:3: Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to\n          the sepulchre.\n          <br />\n          20:4: So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun\n          Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.\n          <br />\n          20:5: And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes\n          lying; yet went he not in.\n          <br />\n          20:6: Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the\n          sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,\n          <br />\n          20:7: And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the\n          linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.\n          <br />\n          20:8: Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the\n          sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.\n          <br />\n          20:9: For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again\n          from the dead.\n          <br />\n          20:10: Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.\n          <br />\n          20:11: But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she\n          wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,\n          <br />\n          20:12: And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and\n          the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.\n          <br />\n          20:13: And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto\n          them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they\n          have laid him.\n          <br />\n          20:14: And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw\n          Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.\n          <br />\n          20:15: Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest\n          thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if\n          thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I\n          will take him away.\n          <br />\n          20:16: Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto\n          him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.\n          <br />\n          20:17: Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended\n          to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto\n          my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.\n          <br />\n          20:18: Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen\n          the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her.\n          <br />\n          20:19: Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week,\n          when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear\n          of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them,\n          Peace be unto you.\n          <br />\n          20:20: And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his\n          side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.\n          <br />\n          20:21: Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father\n          hath sent me, even so send I you.\n          <br />\n          20:22: And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto\n          them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:\n          <br />\n          20:23: Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and\n          whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.\n          <br />\n          20:24: But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with\n          them when Jesus came.\n          <br />\n          20:25: The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the\n          Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print\n          of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and\n          thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.\n          <br />\n          20:26: And after eight days again his disciples were within, and\n          Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in\n          the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.\n          <br />\n          20:27: Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my\n          hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be\n          not faithless, but believing.\n          <br />\n          20:28: And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.\n          <br />\n          20:29: Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou\n          hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have\n          believed.\n          <br />\n          20:30: And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his\n          disciples, which are not written in this book:\n          <br />\n          20:31: But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the\n          Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through\n          his name.\n          <br />\n          21:1: After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples\n          at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.\n          <br />\n          21:2: There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and\n          Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other\n          of his disciples.\n          <br />\n          21:3: Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him,\n          We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship\n          immediately; and that night they caught nothing.\n          <br />\n          21:4: But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but\n          the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.\n          <br />\n          21:5: Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They\n          answered him, No.\n          <br />\n          21:6: And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the\n          ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not\n          able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.\n          <br />\n          21:7: Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is\n          the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his\n          fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into\n          the sea.\n          <br />\n          21:8: And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were\n          not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the\n          net with fishes.\n          <br />\n          21:9: As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals\n          there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.\n          <br />\n          21:10: Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now\n          caught.\n          <br />\n          21:11: Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great\n          fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so\n          many, yet was not the net broken.\n          <br />\n          21:12: Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples\n          durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.\n          <br />\n          21:13: Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish\n          likewise.\n          <br />\n          21:14: This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his\n          disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.\n          <br />\n          21:15: So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son\n          of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea,\n          Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.\n          <br />\n          21:16: He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas,\n          lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love\n          thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.\n          <br />\n          21:17: He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest\n          thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time,\n          Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things;\n          thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.\n          <br />\n          21:18: Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou\n          girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou\n          shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall\n          gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.\n          <br />\n          21:19: This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God.\n          And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.\n          <br />\n          21:20: Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved\n          following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord,\n          which is he that betrayeth thee?\n          <br />\n          21:21: Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man\n          do?\n          <br />\n          21:22: Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what\n          is that to thee? follow thou me.\n          <br />\n          21:23: Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that\n          disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not\n          die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?\n          <br />\n          21:24: This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and\n          wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.\n          <br />\n          21:25: And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the\n          which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the\n          world itself could not contain the books that should be written.
